## Structured Query Language

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. Initially, the name of the language was meant to be Sequel (Structured English Query Language). However, due to copyright, the name was shortened to SQL

SQL is the set of instructions used to interact with databases. Of course, this is a straightforward definition for such a complex subject.

Let’s go a little deeper. SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data stored in a relational database management system. SQL is the language with which a coder communicates with a database to manipulate its data. It is their guiding hand, voice, and fingertips dragging across a screen, helping the coder navigate and organise the data as they see fit. It is how a coder converses with the machine.

What is SQL used for?

SQL is used for database architecture and management. Thus, it is a vital tool used by any individual who seeks to pursue a career as a database administrator. For those unfamiliar with programming languages and website architecture, the work of SQL will often go unnoticed. Still, those who have seen behind the curtain will know it as one of the fundamental building blocks of modern database architecture.

Benefits of using SQL

Despite being one of the older languages having been designed at IBM in the early 1970s, SQL is as strong as ever due to its adaptability to evolving, ease of use, and the fact that it doesn’t overcomplicate things. It understands the vital but straightforward function it provides, and it goes about doing that. Where so many programming languages have failed to adapt over time, SQL has consistently provided what it has advertised and has cemented its place as the backbone of data architecture. Here are some of its benefits.

Use & Access: 
One of the significant benefits of the SQL database language is that it allows users to quickly insert, update, delete, or retrieve data with simple commands. Users can use administrative functions and manage a database a lot easier, and users can remotely access data by using SQL. 
Universally Used
Another benefit of SQL is is that it is widely used among various platforms
